# GOOGLE BOOKS APPLICATION

## TODO

1. Implement localization with TransLoco package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngneat/transloco)
2. Delete behavior of opening specific book on separate page. Instead of that use modal dialog or somethink like that
3. Instead of bootstrap inputs, use Angular material (https://material.angular.io/)
4. Add "Clear results" button to books grid
